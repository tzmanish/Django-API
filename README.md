# Django-API

The objective was to create a web page which accepts the input time in seconds and outputs the nearest value from a JSON object having key as the timestamp value in milliseconds. 
- Write an back-end API to access the JSON object using http GET method and get the value.

JSON: https://github.com/tzmanish/Django-API/blob/master/resources/backend.json

Note:  The field named 'bbox' in the JSON data refers to the bounding box of the respective object and the values are the left-top and right-bottom co-ordinates in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2].
